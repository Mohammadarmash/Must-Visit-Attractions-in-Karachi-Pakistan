    <hr>
    <h4 style="text-align: center;">Karachi, which was once the prehistoric humble abode of Sindhi fishermen, is now a
        roaring urban economy that sustains the country with its large seaports. Always up and running, the streets of
        Karachi are a cacophony of colourful buses, impatient people and the infectious energy of its daily hustle. But
        are there any attractions here that will make you forget all the chaos? Yes! And we have gathered the best of
        them for you.</h4>

        <h1>Origins of MagnifiScience</h1>
        <p>In 2016, The Dawood Foundation conducted its first science exhibition, called MagnifiScience exhibition at
            the Dawood Public School. Due to its success, it was held again the following year at the same premises.
            Thereafter, Pakistan's first science studio - TDF MagnifiScience Children's Studio - was opened in 2018. In
            October 2018, a science exhibition was held in Islamkot, Sindh.An increasing need for a larger space led to
            the start of the construction of the building in 2019.

            In November 2021, the President of Pakistan, Dr Arif Alvi, officially inaugurated the Science Centre.</p>
        <h1>Building architecture</h1>
        <p>The Science Centre building spread over ground-plus-three-floor has been designed Madiha Ghani of Shahab
            Ghani and Associates. The MSC is a pre-engineered building, which is seismically sound, and conceptualised
            to minimise environmental impact. As part of its green initiatives, the premises feature a solar power
            system and a wastewater recycling system.
            <br> <b>Interior and exhibitions</b>
            <br> The over 200 exhibits across the floors showcase different themes addressing various scientific topics
            and concepts that are pertinent in the Pakistani context. These include different architectural and cultural
            elements of Karachi, sources of food, constructions and modes of transportation. The facility also covers
            the themes of human body, light, sound, illusions, mathematics, and physics including renewable energy and
            telecommunication.
            In addition to the main exhibition areas, there is also a simulation of mangrove ecosystem installed inside
            the building which highlights the importance of native flora and fauna along Pakistan’s coastline.

            In the centre’s auditorium, science-related documentaries are screened as well as science-related program
            and workshops are held on a regular basis.
            <br>
            <b>Outdoor areas</b>
            <br>
            he original property of the science centre was formerly a colonial warehouse building located within the
            historic Railway Quarter. Adjacent to the property, passes the Karachi Circular Railway and the adjoining
            areas have a series of warehouses constructed during the British Raj. The site was originally owned by Ralli
            Brothers Ltd in 1888.[13] Today, the only remains of the warehouse are the stone boundary walls around the
            entire venue and a gatehouse which have been restored to bring back their original character as much as
            possible.

            The outdoor area comprises also the centre’s Science Garden which features a playground, a natural maze and
            many indigenous trees and plants.

            In front of the building are a few outdoor exhibits, games, and a pond featuring science-related-information
            about its organisms living within.
