            is a recreational
            area built in Karachi, Sindh,
            Pakistan along the waterfront of the 19th century Native Jetty Bridge that connects the Karachi Port Trust
            to Keamari. The project was a result of joint efforts made by the Karachi Port Trust and a private company
            Grand Leisure Corporation. The complex was opened for public on 28 May 2011, with then Governor of Sindh,
            Ishratul Ibad inaugurating the complex. The complex is a hub of shopping, dining, cultural and coastal
            recreational activities in the city.

            Port Grand is located on Napier Mole Bridge a site that is very significant to the history of Karachi and
            has played a crucial role in making it the city it is today. The project stretches along 1,000 ft of
            Karachi's ancient 19th century Native Jetty Bridge and spreads over an area of 200,000 sq. ft.

            The one kilometer bridge has been transformed into an entertainment and food enclave housing numerous
            eateries totaling 40,000 sq. ft of climate-controlled area and space for kiosks and 11 restaurants of exotic
            Pakistani and foreign food and a variety of beverages.To attract more people, the management has also
            started offering speedboat rides that take passengers along China Creek. The riders can also see the
            mangroves planted there, but do not actually pass through them.The management also hopes that the speedboat
            rides will help people understand the need to protect mangroves and reduce marine pollution

                the Leader') is the resting place of Muhammad Ali Jinnah situated in Karachi, Sindh. The marble monument
                comprises a surface area of 3,100 square metres (33,000 square feet). It is surrounded by formal gardens
                and designed in an Islamic modernist style.

                Following Jinnah's death in 1948, his tomb was capped by a small dome and remained in poor conditions.
                In 1957, the Government of Pakistan held an international competition for the design of the mausoleum.
                The design of the victorious William Whitfield attained prominent distinction, though his work was
                rejected by Jinnah's sister Fatima. She sought the support of the public and subsequently approved the
                design of Jinnah's close friend Yahya Merchant in 1960. The mausoleum's construction concluded in 1971
                and was inaugurated by Yahya Khan, the then-president of Pakistan.

                Mazar-e-Quaid is regarded as one of the iconic monuments of Pakistan. Along with Jinnah, it entombs
                several other activists of the Pakistan Movement, making it a common place for celebrations of the
                Independence Day in the country. <sub>wikipedia</sub> <button><a href="./Mazar-e-Quaid.html">More
