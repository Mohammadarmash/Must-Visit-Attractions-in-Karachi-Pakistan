        roaring urban economy that sustains the country with its large seaports. Always up and running, the streets of
        Karachi are a cacophony of colourful buses, impatient people and the infectious energy of its daily hustle. But
        are there any attractions here that will make you forget all the chaos? Yes! And we have gathered the best of
        them for you.</h4>
